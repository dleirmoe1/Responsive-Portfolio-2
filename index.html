				<p>I am a serious, fun and caring person. I am a wife and mother of 4. My husbands name is Dave, I have 3 sons named Sean (17), Seth (16), Brandon (12), and my only daughter Darla (1). Being a mom is my most important job. I love being a mom and feel so blessed that my four kids chose me to be their mom.</p> 
				
				<p> Taking this bootcamp has been pretty challenging something I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. I took this course wanting to learn coding. I have no techincal background and wanted to learn coding because my company is a tech company. I work for Epsilon a marketing company in automotive. We send out coupons via mail, and email for car dealerships. I currently work in eStrike. I'm a digital marketing specialist for our email campaigns. I enjoy my job and and working for Epsilon. I have learned a lot in this bootcamp course however not enough to feel like I can go out and find a job in web development but that's ok. My plan is to keep learning and teaching myself now that I have some tools in place.
